- Custom Plots in wandb:
Very buggy! If nonsense happens, start it over.
1. edit DATASOURCE with relevant variables
(needs to be done with point and click, because that's why you want code for...)

untabbed version:

query {
runSets
(runSets: "${runSets}",limit: 500)
 {
id
name
history
(keys: [
"epoch","metrics/evaluation/eval_acc"]
)
config
(keys: ["max_len","vocab_size"]
)
}
}


2. edit plot specs
Copy code (e.g. filtered_lineplot.json) & then select x, y and color manually (...)

3. Important:
- When closing editor, everything will disappear.
- When saving to workspace, there will be an error.
- When saving to report, there will be an error.
The only way to keep the custom plot is to save it as a new preset. This will in turn save it in the workspace.
Any edit on a preset needs to be saved (?!), otherwise you end up with two identical plots.
So a new preset is necessary for e.g. every parameter value (?!)

Saved presets ids:
koala-lab/plot_with_filtered_config_values

Custom plots via presets can be created from workspace and sent to reports.
It's slow and ugly but it seems the only way to create custom plots.
